# Farini-VC-AD-ADSR-convertion
An attempt to convert a 3310 based VC ADSR from Kosmo format, to Eurorack

'3320' on the panel has been fixed!

Cheers Dave!

Current Status : initial build tested with spectacular results! My entire rack stopped producing audio apart from a high pitched noise coming from the PSU, so, I think I'll chalk this one up as a fail. My only 3310 chip is probably toasted now too, so I can't really continue to work on this, sadly.
